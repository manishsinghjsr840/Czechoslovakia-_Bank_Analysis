# Czechoslovakia-_Bank_Analysis
Czechoslovakia Bank Financial Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing financial data from Czechoslovakia Bank to identify trends, patterns, and potential risks. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help the bank make informed decisions regarding their financial operations and explore opportunities for introducing new financial products or services.

Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
Tool Used: Microsoft Excel
Description: The raw data was first cleaned in Excel to ensure accuracy and completeness. This included handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing any inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. Data Storage
Tool Used: Amazon S3
Description: After data cleaning, the cleaned data was uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket for secure and scalable storage. S3 provides a reliable and cost-effective storage solution that integrates well with other AWS services.
3. Data Integration
Tool Used: Snowflake (via AWS Storage Integration)
Description: The data stored in the S3 bucket was then connected to Snowflake through AWS Storage Integration. This connection allowed for efficient data querying and analysis within Snowflake's cloud data platform.
4. Ad Hoc Analysis
Tool Used: Snowflake
Description: Ad hoc analysis was conducted in Snowflake to explore the data, generate insights, and answer specific business questions posed by the bank. This involved writing SQL queries to analyze various aspects of the bank's financial operations.
5. Data Visualization

Tool Used: Power BI
Description: The results from the ad hoc analysis were visualized in Power BI. Dashboards were created to present the findings in an interactive and user-friendly manner, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret the data and make data-driven decisions.
